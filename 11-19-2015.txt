Notes:
	Possibly changing layout:
		Map vs. Graphs first?
			Change it.
			Scaling. Label map information.
			Color change (red? Rep) - Edit range of the colors since it could be confusing. (Red to Green?)
		Additinal Graphs:
			Parallel line graphs. - Lets the user to interact with the data more.
		Time:
			Look at major events, that we know happened, and then analyze tweets within those dates/times. 



	To Do:
		Add Donald Trump Tweet feed to his trump.html
		State-wide poll data - Do numbers/sentiment correlate?
		Local poll data - Do numbers/sentiment correlate? Contextualize what we've collected**
		Number of tweets displayed (State and Nationally)
